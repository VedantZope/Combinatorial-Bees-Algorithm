## Installation

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Install the necessary libraries and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

A dummy dataset was used for this project, which is based on previous weather data. This dataset serves to demonstrate the working of the bee-inspired optimization algorithm for UAV speed prediction.

## File Structure

- `myenv/`: Contains the virtual environment with necessary libraries and dependencies.
- `Optimised_Route_Plots(CBA-ML)/`: Directory with optimized route plots using the CBA-ML approach.
- `Optimised_Route_Plots(CBA)/`: Directory with optimized route plots using the CBA approach.
- `Reports/`: Contains project reports and relevant documentation.
- `Weather_Data/`: Directory with weather data files.
- `BA_C.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the initial code and development details.
- `bee_algorithm.py`: Implementation of the bee-inspired optimization algorithm.
- `data_module.py`: Handles data loading, preprocessing, and splitting.
- `main.py`: Main execution script to run the entire process.
- `visualization.py`: Module for visualizing the optimization results.

## Usage

To run the main script and execute the entire process:

```bash
python main.py
```
